        <h2>The development phase</h2>
        <p>The development of Mario began in the early 1980s when Nintendo, a Japanese video game company, was searching for a 
            flagship character to help them break into the North American video game market. Nintendo's visionary designer, 
            Shigeru Miyamoto, created the character Mario and his debut game, "Donkey Kong," was released in 1981.<br><br>

            Originally known as "Jumpman," Mario was a carpenter tasked with rescuing his girlfriend, Pauline, from the giant 
            ape Donkey Kong. The game became a massive success, establishing Mario as a recognizable character and inspiring a 
            series of sequels and spin-offs.<br><br>

            In 1983, Mario starred in his own game called "Mario Bros." This arcade game introduced Mario's brother, Luigi, and 
            featured them working together to clear out pests from underground sewers. "Mario Bros." also marked the first 
            appearance of the iconic green pipes and many gameplay elements that would become staples of the franchise.<br><br>

            The breakthrough for Mario came in 1985 with the release of "Super Mario Bros." for the Nintendo Entertainment System 
            (NES). This side-scrolling platformer became a global phenomenon and revolutionized the video game industry. It introduced 
            new gameplay mechanics, such as scrolling levels, power-ups like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, and the ability to 
            save progress through the use of warp zones. "Super Mario Bros." became the best-selling video game of all time at that
            point and cemented Mario's status as a pop culture icon.<br><br>

            Following the success of "Super Mario Bros.," Nintendo continued to release sequels and spin-offs featuring Mario. 
            "Super Mario Bros. 2" was released in 1988 and introduced unique gameplay mechanics, such as picking up and throwing objects. 
            "Super Mario Bros. 3" arrived in 1990, introducing a world map, diverse power-ups, and a multitude of secrets to discover.<br><br>

            With the advent of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1990, Mario made the leap to 16-bit graphics. 
            "Super Mario World" became a launch title for the SNES and is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time. 
            It introduced Yoshi, a dinosaur companion for Mario, and showcased vibrant visuals and intricate level design.<br><br>

            In the transition to 3D gaming, Nintendo released "Super Mario 64" in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 console. This groundbreaking 
            title introduced players to a fully 3D world where they could freely explore and interact with the environment. It set a 
            new standard for 3D platforming and demonstrated Nintendo's commitment to innovation.<br><br>

            Since then, Mario has continued to evolve across various Nintendo consoles, with notable entries including "Super Mario Sunshine" 
            (GameCube), "Super Mario Galaxy" (Wii), "New Super Mario Bros." series (Nintendo DS and Wii), and "Super Mario Odyssey" 
            (Nintendo Switch). These games have pushed the boundaries of gameplay, graphics, and creativity, while maintaining the core 
            elements that make Mario games so beloved.<br><br>

            Mario's influence extends beyond video games. The character has appeared in animated TV shows, comics, movies, and merchandise, 
            solidifying his status as one of the most recognizable and enduring icons in popular culture.<br><br>

            In conclusion, the development of Mario is a story of continuous innovation and creative evolution. From his humble beginnings in 
            "Donkey Kong" to his groundbreaking 3D adventures, Mario's journey has shaped the gaming industry and brought joy to millions of 
            players worldwide.<br><br>
