        <h2>What is the game about?</h2>
        <p> Super Mario is a video game franchise that follows the adventures of Mario, a heroic plumber, and his companions as they 
            embark on quests to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of the primary antagonist, Bowser.<br><br>

            The games typically take place in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, a colorful and diverse world filled with various themed 
            levels, including grasslands, deserts, icy landscapes, and underwater environments. Mario must navigate through these levels, 
            overcoming obstacles, jumping on enemies, and collecting power-ups to aid him in his quest.<br><br>

            The central objective of most Super Mario games is to rescue Princess Peach, who is often kidnapped by Bowser, the leader of 
            the Koopa Troop, a group of turtle-like creatures. Bowser's motivations vary, but he generally seeks to conquer the Mushroom 
            Kingdom or marry Peach against her will.<br><br>

            Mario's abilities include running, jumping, and stomping on enemies, which defeats them. Throughout the games, players can discover 
            power-ups like mushrooms that make Mario grow larger, fire flowers that allow him to shoot fireballs, and stars that grant temporary
            invincibility.<br><br>

            The franchise's gameplay is known for its precise controls, inventive level design, and a balance of challenging and accessible 
            gameplay. Players must navigate platforming challenges, defeat enemies, and often face off against powerful bosses in order to 
            progress.<br><br>

            Super Mario games often incorporate a variety of gameplay elements, such as puzzles, hidden secrets, and side-scrolling or 3D exploration. 
            Additionally, multiplayer modes and cooperative play are commonly available, allowing friends or family members to join in the fun.
            <br><br>

            The franchise has expanded beyond traditional platforming, featuring spin-off titles in different genres, including racing (Mario Kart), 
            sports (Mario Tennis, Mario Golf), and party games (Mario Party). These games showcase the iconic characters from the Super Mario universe 
            engaging in friendly competition or cooperative gameplay.<br><br>

            Overall, Super Mario is beloved for its charming characters, imaginative worlds, and engaging gameplay. It has become one of the most iconic 
            and influential franchises in the history of video games, captivating players of all ages for decades.
